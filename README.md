Quick summary: This program creates sudoku puzzles through an API request and then solves it using the recursive backtracking algorithm.

So I've always liked playing sudoku and thought this would be a fun project to do because it's something I like.

The hardest part was the recursive backtracking algorithm because I am still around the beginner/intermediate level and recursion can be difficult sometimes. I did this project to help build up my algorithm skills and my recursion skills. Like anything on the internet I could have easily plagiarized someone elses code to do this, but I honestly didn't. My method was to force myself to figure out the correct solution. I spent multiple days practicing recursion problems and eventually moved on to try this by myself. Eventually I got it and was very proud of myself haha. Anyways the only other difficult part was realizing that you can't create sudoku puzzles by randomly putting numbers on a board because of the way math and the rules of sudoku work, so I had to end up using an API to generate boards.

Thanks!
